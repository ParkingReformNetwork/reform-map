The study ultimately showed that there was an excess of available parking (up to 65%) during times of peak use, and as a result, the City revised 10 of its requirements to reflect the actual parking demand. Additionally, the City worked with Upstate Forever to create a fee-in-lieu program that requires developers who install more than the minimum requirement of parking spaces to either pay a fee for each additional space (to be used for stormwater management) or install LID to treat the stormwater runoff created as a result. -Erika Hollis","Unverified",NA,NA,NA,"Erika Hollis",0,70635,NA,NA,34.851354,-82.3984882,"GreenvilleSCUS","red","car",0.2,"not_special_icon",NA
